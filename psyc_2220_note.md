#### What is Psychology?
  Psychology – The scientific study of human feelings, behavior and thoughts <br>
  The ABCs of Psychology:
  * __Affect__: person's feelings/emotions
  * __Behavior__: how we act and behave
  * __Cognition__: person's belief/knowledge
------

#### The Basics of Industrial/Organizational Psychology
  I/O Psychology – The scientific study and application of psychological principles to work
  What is work?
  ```
  Good work is work that “exhibits a high level of expertise, and it entails
  regular concern with the implications and applications of an individual’s work for the
  wider world”
  ```
  * Industrial Psychology: Tends to focus on ways to improve, evaluate, and predict employee performance
  * Organizational Psychology: Tends to focus on how organizations affect individuals.

  What is the purpose of I/O Psychology?

  What is an I/O Psychologist?
  * Scientists who derive principles of individual, group, and organizational behavior through research
  * Practioners who develop scientific knowledge and apply it to the solution of problems at work
------

#### History of I/O Psychology
##### Wilhelm Wundt
  * Founded one of the first PSYC lab
  * trained Hugo Munsterberg and James McKeen Cattell
  * Initially, he was a devoted experimental psychologist who actually rejected any value for the application of psychology to the workplace (Benjamin, 2006). Soon, however, he saw the potential of psychology to address many practical problems of the early
20th century.
##### Hugo Munsterberg
  * People are “replacement parts” that need to fit the organization’s needs
  * Munsterberg was also one of the first to measure abilities in workers and tie those abilities to performance
  * Wrote the first I-O psychology textbook
##### Frank & Lilian Gilbreth
  * Human beings are the most important element in industry
##### Roberty Yerkes & Walter Dill Scott
  * Scientific Management; Time and motion study
  * Army Alpha & Beta test; Indivisual Differences
##### The Hawthorne Studies
  * The Hawthorne Effect – Change in behavior following the onset of novel treatment (typically, new or increased attention)
  ** Typically wears off as novelty of stimulus decreases
  * Human Relations Movement
##### WWII
  * Plane cookpit design; Human enginnering
  * Ability Testing
##### Civil Rights Act of 1964
  * No discrimination
##### What questions are relevant to I/O researchers
  ```
    1. Mental ability tests have always played an important part in the practice of industrial psychology.

    2. Most industrial psychologists were focused on improving productivity and reducing counterproductive behavior such as absenteeism and turnover.

    3. There was a tendency to see the three different branches of I-O psychology as unrelated to, and possibly in competition with, one another to explain industrial behavior.
    4. It was taken for granted that the unit of analysis was the individual worker rather than the work group, organization, or even culture.

    We make these generalizations to highlight the difference between the I-O psychology of 1964 and the I-O psychology of today. Consider how those generalizations above would change to be applicable today.

    1. Mental ability is only one of a number of important attributes that play a role in the practice of I-O psychology. Personality characteristics are assuming an increasingly important role in understanding and predicting work behavior.

    2. Although many I-O psychologists continue to address issues of productivity and efficiency, others explore issues of worker well-being, work–family balance, and the experience of work by workers. Some I-O psychologists are embracing large 21st century issues such as an aging workforce and world poverty.

    3. I-O psychologists see the three major branches of the discipline as complementary rather than independent or antagonistic. I-O psychologists take a systems view of work behavior and acknowledge that there are many individual, social, work environment, and organizational variables that interact to produce behavior at the workplace.

    4. The worker is one level of analysis, but the work group, the organization, and even the culture represent additional and valuable levels of analysis.

#### Cross-Cultural Issues in I/O Psychology
  Culture: A system in which individuals share meanings and common ways of viewing events and objects.

  Why does culture matter in I/O psychology research?

  __Hofstede’s Theory of Culture__
  * Individualism vs Collectivism
  * Power Distance
  * Uncertainty Avoidance
  * Masculinity vs. Femininity
  * Long-term vs. Short-term orientation

  Why should management pay attention to culture?

  What are the positives about Hofstede’s Theory of Culture?

  What are the negatives about Hofstede’s Theory of Culture?


## Chapter2: Methods & Statistics of I/O Psychology <a name="chapter-2"></a>
  ### Learning Objectives
  * How do I/O Psychologists conduct research?
  * How Do I/O Psychologists analyze data?
  * How Do I/O Psychologists infer from results?
------

### Research Process
  1. Identify the problem
    * Theory - An integrated set of principles that predicts and explains observed evets
      - Summarizes and organizes information
    * Develop hypotheses on the basis of theory
      - Hypothesis - A specificm testable statement about the nature of the relationship among two or ore variables
  2. Design procedures to test hypothesis
    * Try to imagine how to "disprove" it
  3. Establish a measurement process
    * How can you collect data about the attributes
  4. Analyze your data
    * What is the data saying?
  5. Draw conclusions
    * What reasonable inferences do the results support?
  6. Write up results
    * Be humble, tell a meaningful story, admit limitations
  7. Eash rinse, repeat
------

### The Reasearch Process: Variables
  __Concepture Variable__: Abstract and general, what the researcher truly wants to measure. (i.e. Mental Ability)

  __Operational Definition__: Specific procedure for manipulating or measring a conceptual variable. (i.e. IQ)

  __Independent Variable__: Variable that is hypothesized to influence outcome

  __Dependent Variable__: The outcome we're interesed in examing

  __Moderator__: Changes the nature of the relationship in question (i.e., the conditions under which a relationship exists or not). Basically a additional inpendent variable.

  __Mediator__: Effects of IV on DV "go through" the mediator
  ```
    IV -----> DV       IV ---> Med --->DV
         |
        Mod
    Moderator               Mediator
  ```
------

### The Research Process: The Design
I/O psychology has 3 basic types of research designs: Experimental, quasi-experimental, and non-experimental

__Experimental__: Research that randomly assigns people to different conditions, thus enabling researchers to make strong inferences about how different conditions affect behavior

  * Define the population of interest
  * Drqw a random sample from that population (N)
    - __Sample__: The sub-set of the population you use to make inferences
    - __Random Sample__: Everyone in the population of interest has an squal probability of being selected to participate
  * Tandomly assign participants into either the control condition or the experimental condition
  * Compare scores on the DV(s) of interest across the two grpups
    - Typically invalves statistical tests that look for "statistically significant differences" across groups
  * Pros of Experimental Research
    - Allows researches to eliminate alternative explanations
    - Relatively easy and cost effective
  * Cons of experimental Research
    - Lacks external validity: will findings applyu to the real-world
    - Conducted less frequently in I/O (33% for lab experiments)

__Quasi-Experimental__: Participants are assigned to different conditions, but random assignment to conditions is not possible
  * Define the population of interest
  * Draw a random sample from that population (N)
  * Distinguish the groups for your research from that sample
  * Due to the nature of your sample or question, random assignment to conditions is not possible
     - E.g. Individual difference comparisons, field samples, etc.
  * Compare scores on the DV(s) of interest across the groups
  * Pros of Quasi-Experimental Research
    - Using field samples allows for greater generalizability
  * Cons of Quasi-Experimental Research
    - No true control over the experiment

__Nonexperimental__: Does not include any “treatment” or assignment to different conditions; uses surveys or observations.
  * No manipulations, simply gather information from sample
  * __Observational__: watches behavior and record what is observed
  * __Survey__: Participants complete questionnaire assessing variables of interest to researcher
------

### Correlational Research Design
  * Define the population of interest
  * Draw a random sample of that population
  * Carefully measure the IVs and DVs of interest
  * Examine the relationship between IVs and DVs
    - If X increases, what happens to Y?

  * Pros of Correlational Research 
    - Very flexible technique – lots of statistical possibilities
    - Does not require “dichotomizing’ variables of interest 
    - Able to help address real-world questions w/ real-world data

  * Cons of Correlational Research 
    - Requires very careful attention to measurement
    - Cannot firmly establish causality
    - E.g., There is a statistically significant relationship between ice cream sales and murder rates

### The Research Process: Design Validity
#### Internal Validity
  * Extent to which we can draw cause-effect conclusions 
  * A function of random assignment 
  * Can be very high in experimental research, but low in correlational

#### External Validity
  * Extent to which our findings represent the real-world phenomenon of interest
  * A function of random sampling 
  * Can be very high in correlational research, but low in experimental

### Methods of Data Analysis
__Meta-analysis__: Statistical method for combining and analyzing the results from many studies to draw a general conclusion
__Descriptive statistics__: Statistics that summarize, organize, and describe a sample of data
  * Merely provides information about your sample
  * Central Tendencies (mean, median, mode)
    - Mean = Average 
    - Median = Center value
    - Mode = Most common value
    - \*These are the same if you have a normal distribution
  * Spread(variance, standard devication, kurtosis)
    - Low Variance (Leptokurtic)
    - Normal
    - High (Platykurtic)
  * Skew(skewness)
    - Positive Skew
    - Normal Skew
    - Negative Skew
    - "The tail tells the tale"
__Inferential Statistics__: Statistics used to aid the researcher in testing hypotheses and making inferences from sample data to a larger sample or population
  * Inferential statistics allow us to make judgments about out population based on our sample
  * Statistically Significant - In a world where there are absolutely on differences between the two groups, what is the probability that we will find a difference as big as the one we actually did
  * Statistical power: The likelihood of finding a statistically significant difference when a true diference exists
  * Differences across groups:
    - T-Tests: Tests difference between 2 groups
    - ANOVA: Tests difference between more than 2 groups
  * Relationship w other constructs
    - Correlation (esp. Pearson Product Moment correlation)
    - Regression

__Correlations__
  * Pearson Product Moment Correlation - represented by "r"
  * Quantifies linear relationship between 2 variables
  * Sign (- or +) simply tells you the direction of the relationship
  * Value tells you the strength of the relationship
  * Corrected Correlations(p)
    - We never measure anything perfectly, thus our correlations are inherehty attenuated by random errore
    - Corrected correlations are always >= observed correlations
  * Multiple Regression
    - Same as above, we just add more predictors
    - E.g., intelligence, conscientiousness, experience and job performance
    - Predictors designated as X1, X2, X3.....XN
    - Represented by “R” – R2 represents the proportion of variability in Y attributable to the set of all predictors

  __Regression__
  * Similar to correlation, but used when we want to predict scores on Y based on values of X
    - Y = B0 + B1X1 + e

  __Multiple Regression__
  * Same as above, we just add more predictors (IVs)
  * Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + ... + BnXn + e

  __Linear vs nonlinear__
  * NOt all relationships linear, can be curcilinear
  * No correlation != no relationship

  __Drawing Inferences__
   * What if your inferences seem wrong?
   * Theory was wrong?
   * Information (data) is bad? Bad measurement? Bad research design? Inadequate sample?
   * Analysis was Wrong?

### Inferring Results from Research
  * Measure: Any mechanism, procedure, tool, instrument, etc. that purports to translate attributes into numerical values •
  * How do you determine the accuracy of the information gathered from our asures?
    - Answers: Reliability Evidence – How consistent are our measurements?
    - Proporation of systematic variance to random error variance
  * Validity Evidence – Are we making reasonable inferences on the basis of our measurements?
